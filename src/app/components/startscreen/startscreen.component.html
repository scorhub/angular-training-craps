    <h2>Craps: Pass line</h2>
    <h4>Rules:</h4>
    <p>You have 100 credits.</p>
    <p>Roll two dice. For come-outs of 7 and 11, you win (double the bet).</p>
    <p>If come-out is 2, 3, or 12, you lose your bet.</p>
    <p>If the roll is any other value, it establishes a point.</p>
    <p>If, with a point established, that point is rolled again before a 7, the bet wins.</p>
    <p>If, with a point established, a 7 is rolled before the point is rolled again ("seven out"), the bet loses.</p>
